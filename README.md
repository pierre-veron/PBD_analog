# PBD_analog
Test the analogy between the protracted birth-death model and the birth-death 
model.

## Overview
Simulations and statistical inferences of phylogenies under the protracted 
birth-death (PBD) model following the works from 
> Etienne, R. S., & Rosindell, J. (2012). Prolonging the Past Counteracts the Pull of the Present: Protracted Speciation Can Explain Observed Slowdowns in Diversification. _Systematic Biology, 61_, 204.

> Etienne, R. S., Morlon, H., & Lambert, A. (2014). Estimating the duration of speciation from phylogenies. _Evolution, 68_, 2430–2440.

Test of the analog expressions of birth and death rates from the PBD model. 

## Project architecture
Code : 
* `modules/PBD_analog.py` : implementation of the equivalent birth-death rates from the PBD model and function to simulate a PBD process. 
* `1-rate_analysis` : calculate and explore the equivalent BD rates based on the PBD parameters.
* `2-simulate_trees` : simulate trees in the 
    * PBD process 
    * constant BD and time dependant BD process with rates calculated based on the same parameters as the PBD process
* `3-compare_PBD_BD_varBD` : compares the statistics of the trees derived in the previous pipeline. 

Output : 
* `simulations_output` : generated trees and their statistics 
* `fig` : figures generated by the different pipelines 

Other : 
* `illustrations` : illustrations of the process for the manuscript.
