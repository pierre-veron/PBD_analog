## Files
* `1-calculate_probas_rates.ipynb`: a notebook to calculate and plot the time-dependant rates based on parameters of the PBD process.
* `2-explor_time_dep_rates.ipynb`: a notebook to explore the dependance between those rates and the PBD parameters. 
* `3-influence_params.ipynb`: a notebook to explore the influence of PBD parameters on the constant BD rates.
* `4-influence_params_simplifiedPBD.ipynb`: a notebook to explore the influence of parameters of the _simplified_ PBD process (with $b:= \lambda_1 = \lambda_3$ and $e:=\mu_1=\mu_2$) on the constant BD rates.
