## Files
* `PBD_analog.py`: a Python file used to implement the stochastic simulations of the PBD process (without tree reconstruction, see the R package `PBD`) and the estimation of the equivalent BD rates (constant _and_ time-dependant) based on the PBD parameters. 
* `graph_tools.py`: a Python file containing functions used for graphics.
